it takes me 3-4 hrs overall
I finish all the features from the video.
I do some work on settings.

I use a slider to let user set the rate from 0 to 100.
And store it in NSUserDefaults.

Most of the time is trying to get familiar with the IDE and data fetching & writing.
Like how to read from slider bar and show up. How to play with Navigator.

Sorry that this submission is late.
I was forwarded that email by one of my friend who has enrolled.
I just rush it up and hopefully I can get enrolled.
